              <h2>All Things Fenty</h2>
              <h3>Makeup:</h3> 
                <p>Rihanna began her makeup line “<b>Fenty Beauty</b>” in September 2017 to make sure that all of her products were inclusive to all skin tones, due to limited skin tone ranges in other cosmetic brands. In her first release, there was an affordable range of products such as 40 shades of foundation, three different shade sets of highlighter and contour sticks, primer, a universal lip gloss, universal blotting powder along with makeup brushes. Currently she continues to introduce more products such as eyeshadow, lipstick, blush, bronzer and body lava (body highlight) that are suitable for all people of colour. There's also one product where all purchases go towards the <a class="link content" href="https://claralionelfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Clara Lionel Foundation</a> that she founded herself in 2012. All funds from those who purchased the <a class="link content" href="https://www.fentybeauty.com/killawatt-freestyle-highlighter-clf-edition-/FB40010.html" target="_blank">"Diamond Ball Out"</a> Killawat Freestyle Highlighter supporting those suffering from natural disasters to helping children who are not able to access an education.
                <p>You can buy online directly from <a class="link content" href="https://www.fentybeauty.com/" target="_blank">Fenty Beauty</a> or online and in-store at <a class="link content" href="https://www.sephora.com.au/brands/fenty-beauty" target="_blank">Sephora</a>.</p>

              <h3>Clothing</h3>
                <h4>PumaXFenty</h4>
                  <p>Rihanna first began producing clothing, in 2016, through her collaboration with Puma, PumaXFenty. The collaboration was in popular demand that four seasons of this collection were released as well as four New York Fashion Week (NYFW) Shows were produced up until 2018.</p>
                <h4>Savage X Fenty</h4>
                  <p>Afterwards, Rihanna produced her own lingerie line, <a class="link content" href="https://www.savagex.com/" target="_blank">"Savage X Fenty"</a>. Again, this line continues the pattern of inclusivity by giving an <b>“extensive sizing range”</b> (Vogue) for everyone to express their confidence, as well as making it affordable for her audience. There are also pieces within her lingerie line where a partial amount of anything purchased from the <a class="link content" href="https://www.savagex.com/clf" target="_blank">"CLF Edition"</a> will be donated towards her Clara Lionel Foundation. Savage X Fenty has also showcased two seasons at NYFW. However, instead of having models walk down the runway normally, she (with the help of choreographer Parris Goebel) choreographed a dance for dancers, who were also wearing pieces from her line, to do around the models. The models were a vast range of women of different shapes, sizes, colour and included women who were pregnant.<p>
                <h4>Fenty</h4>
                  <p>Rihanna also created her own high-end fashion line, <a class="link content" href="https://www.fenty.com/gb/en/home" target="_blank">"Fenty"</a>, with the pattern of inclusivity of sizing range continuing  within her minimalist, neutral pieces. The creation of this line made her the <b>“first black woman to run a major luxury fashion house”</b> (The New York Times Styles Magazine).</p>

              <h3>Awards</h3>
                <p>In 2014, Rihanna achieved the <b>”Style Icon”</b> Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). In addition, from her Fenty label she won the <b>“Urban Luxe”</b> category from the British Fashion Awards in 2019.</p>
                <p>Due to her constant contribution to helping those through her Clara Lionel Foundation as well as breast cancer treatment in Barbados, Rihanna earned <b>“Humanitarian of the Year”</b> from the Harvard Foundation for Interracial and Cultural Relations.</p>
